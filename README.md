# Hostel Management System

Welcome to the Hostel Management System project built using Django, SQLite-3, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application provides a seamless experience for both administrators and students, allowing students to apply for outings, room changes, and leave requests.

- **Student Panel:**
  - Apply for outings: Students can request permission to go out.
  - Request room change: Students can apply for a change in their hostel room.
  - Apply for leave: Students can request leave from the hostel.

- **Admin Panel:**
  - Manage student requests: Admins can view and manage outing requests, room change requests, and leave requests submitted by students.
  - User management: Admins can add, edit, or remove student accounts.
  - Room allocation: Admins can assign and manage hostel rooms for students.
  
## Technologies Used
